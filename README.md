# DataInsertMeasureApp
PoC application to measure performance of popular ORMs using .Net C#

This version is mostly focused on three methods of data insertion - PlainSql (it's my name for this method), EF6 and NHibernate

For now it only measures time, but I hope that soon there will be added more params to measure, such as CPU or memory usage
